<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Communication</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Agent Jane sees this is Sev-C emergency ticket and has to reassign ticket to a Support.
</p>
<p>
  She makes sure to change the SLA plane to SEV-C cause it only 2 people are effected and not much info about it.
</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />
<p>
  This was a very simplistic scenario of the creation of a ticket by a user, how the ticket is assigned and displays the communication of a ticket between agents; subsequently resulting in a resolution.
</p>
<p>
  There are additional scenarios that can also happen while a ticket is being assessed. A ticket can either be reassigned to a different department, escalated in severeity level, or needs to be both reassigned to a more qualified agent/department to handle the issue, depending on business impacts.
</p>
<p>
  I hope this tutorial helps you understand and have a better general overview of a life-cycle of a ticket. Help desk agents can expect to regularly deal with anywere between 10 to 100 tickets during their day depeneding on the company size.
